## Geography
Map of Provinces of Argentina:
![Map of Provinces of Argentina](/images/geography.png)

Argentina has a **mainland surface** area of *2,780,400* km2 (1,073,518 sq mi) and is located in [southern South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Cone), sharing land borders with [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile) across the [Andes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes) to the west; [Bolivia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia) and [Paraguay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay) to the north; Brazil to the northeast, [Uruguay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay) and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east; and the Drake Passage to the south; for an overall land border length of *9,376* km (5,826 mi). Its coastal border over the Río de la Plata and South Atlantic Ocean is *5,117* km (3,180 mi) long.

Some of the major rivers are the **Paraná**, **Uruguay** which join to form the **Río de la Plata**, *Paraguay*, *Salado*, *Negro*, *Santa Cruz*, *Pilcomayo*, *Bermejo* and *Colorado*. These rivers are discharged into the **Argentine Sea**, the shallow area of the Atlantic Ocean over the Argentine Shelf, an unusually wide continental platform. Its waters are influenced by two major ocean currents: the warm **Brazil Current** and the cold **Falklands Current**.

## History
[![Colonial Argentina](/images/colonial.jpg)](https://www.chimuadventures.com/blog/2016/11/history-of-argentina/)

Until the period of European colonization, Argentina was relatively sparsely populated by a *wide number of diverse cultures with different social organizations*. The first group are **basic** hunters and food gatherers such as the [Selknam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selk%27nam_people) and [Yaghan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahgan_people) in the extreme south. The second group were more **advanced** hunters which include the [Puelche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puelche_people), [Querandí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Querand%C3%AD) and Serranos in the centre-east; and the [Tehuelche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehuelche_people) in the south. The last group are **farmers* like the [Charrúa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charr%C3%BAa), [Minuane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charr%C3%BAa) and [Guaraní](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaran%C3%AD_people) in the northeast.

#### European Colonization
Europeans first arrived in Argentina with the 1502 voyage of [Amerigo Vespucci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerigo_Vespucci_(explorer)). The Spanish navigators [Juan Díaz de Solís](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_D%C3%ADaz_de_Sol%C3%ADs) and [Sebastian Cabot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Cabot_(explorer)) visited the territory that is now Argentina in 1516 and 1526, respectively.

Further colonization efforts came from **Paraguay**, establishing the *Governorate of the Río de la Plata—Peru* and *Chile*. Francisco de Aguirre founded Santiago del Estero in 1553. Londres was founded in 1558; Mendoza, in 1561; San Juan, in 1562; San Miguel de Tucumán, in 1565. Juan de Garay founded Santa Fe in 1573 and the same year Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera set up Córdoba. Garay went further south to re-found Buenos Aires in 1580. San Luis was established in 1596.

#### Post European/Independance
The 1810 May Revolution replaced the viceroy [Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltasar_Hidalgo_de_Cisneros) with the **First Junta**, a new government in Buenos Aires composed by locals. In the first clashes of the Independence War the Junta crushed a royalist counter-revolution in Córdoba, but failed to overcome those of the Banda Oriental, Upper Peru and Paraguay, which later became independent states.

The French-Argentine [Hippolyte Bouchard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippolyte_Bouchard) brought his fleet to wage war against Spain overseas and attacked **Spanish California**, **Spanish Chile**, **Spanish Peru** and **Spanish Philippines**. He secured the allegiance of escaped Filipinos in San Blas who defected from the Spanish to join the Argentine navy, due to common Argentine and Philippine grievances against Spanish colonization. At a later date, the Argentine Sun of May was adopted as a symbol by the Filipinos in the Philippine Revolution against Spain. He also secured the diplomatic recognition of Argentina from King Kamehameha I of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Historian Pacho O'Donnell affirms that Hawaii was the first state that recognized Argentina's independence.

Revolutionaries split into two antagonist groups: the [Centralists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarian_Party) and the [Federalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federales_(Argentina)), a move that would define Argentina's first decades of independence.

Some of the most important figures of Argentinean independence made a proposal known as the Inca plan of 1816, which proposed that United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (Present Argentina) should be a monarchy, led by a descendant of the Inca. Juan Bautista Túpac Amaru (half-brother of Túpac Amaru II) was proposed as monarch. Some examples of those who supported this proposal were Manuel Belgrano, José de San Martín and Martín Miguel de Güemes. The Congress of Tucumán finally decided to reject the Inca plan, creating instead a republican, centralist state.

## Economy and Trade
###### See the [Economy of Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Argentina) wiki page for more information.
Benefiting from rich natural resources, a highly literate population, a diversified industrial base, and an export-oriented agricultural sector, the economy of Argentina is Latin America's **third-largest**, and the **second largest** in South America. It has a "very high" rating on the Human Development Index and a relatively high GDP per capita, with a considerable internal market size and a growing share of the high-tech sector.

Access to biocapacity in Argentina is *much higher* than world average. In 2016, Argentina had 6.8 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory, much more than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person. In 2016 Argentina used 3.4 global hectares of biocapacity per person – their ecological footprint of consumption. This means they use half as much biocapacity as Argentina contains. As a result, Argentina is running a biocapacity reserve. A middle emerging economy and one of the world's top developing nations, is a member of the G-20 major economies.

Historically, however, its economic performance has been very uneven, with high economic growth alternating with severe recessions, income maldistribution and—in the recent decades—increasing poverty. Early in the 20th century Argentina achieved development, and became the world's seventh richest country. Although managing to keep a place among the top fifteen economies until mid-century, it suffered a long and steady decline, but it is still a high income country.
